This project was used with a template that my lecturer gave me, The template was barebones and was used only for organisation.

The project displays techniques such as shadows, Lights, PBR and basic texturing.

The idea came to me quite quickly as the whole point of this module was to display the programmers skills when it came to GLSL. I picked two techniques to use and those were
PBR and Shadows as they compliment each other quite nicely.
